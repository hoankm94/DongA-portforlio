A space organization combining Bar - Hotel - Restaurant counters renovated from an existing building on Ho Huan Nghiep Street, District 1. Structures that divide space with lightweight materials and quick construction are applied as the main solution. The nature of the material is respected through the surface treatment to achieve visual and spatial emotional effects.
